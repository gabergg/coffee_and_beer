    <p class="about-section"> Coffee n' Beer is our experiment and 6 month adventure. We left our jobs in the
      Silicon
      Valley, and
      we're
      now traveling the United States and Canada. Our aim is to experience as much as possible that we couldn't
      experience in
      the
      constraints of working life.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="span6">
    <p>We'd like to meet as many people as possible along our journey - and we hope you'd like to meet us!
      We're hooked on coffee, and beer's always good, so we thought this would be a fun way to meet people
      and
      explore the country. We'll be developing software as we travel, and we're always looking for company in that
      endeavor as well. </p>

    <h1>Meet up with us</h1>

    <p class="about-section">
      Through our map on the home page, we'd love for you to set up a meeting with us. We're planning our trip
      as we
      go,
      and we're looking to see as much of North America as we can! Meet us for a coffee, a beer, or just to
      hang. We'd
      love to see what excites you. Heck, come camp with us for a few days as we explore the country.
