    <p> Coffee n' Beer is our experiment and 6 month adventure. Jenn and I quit our jobs in the Silicon Valley, and
      we're
      now traveling the United States. Our aim is to experience as much as possible that we couldn't experience in the
      constraints of working life. We'd like to meet as many people as possible along our journey - and we hope you'd
      like
      to meet us! We're hooked on coffee, and beer's always good, so we thought this would be a fun way to meet people
      and
      explore the country. We'll be developing software as we travel, and we're always looking for company in that
      endeavor as well. </p>

    <p> Through our map on the home page, we'd love for you to set up a meeting with us. We're planning our trip as we
      go,
      and we're looking to see as much of North America as we can! Meet us for a coffee, a beer, or just to hang. We'd
      love to see what excites you. Heck, come camp with us for a few days as we explore the country. </p>
