                <p>On Tuesday night we submitted our application for YC!</p>

<p>For those of you that don't know, YCombinator is one of the most prestigious startup accelerators in the US. It's a
venture capital firm that provides support and community to its founders. We're applying with an idea for a language
learning product that we're calling Linguistik.</p>

<p>The most important piece of language learning is finding an opportunity to converse with native speakers. We think
there's a lot of room for improvement in the current tools to find a language partner. There's not a great way to find
a partner with similar interests, values, and skills. This is particularly frustrating because great matchmaking tools
 exist already - they're just applied to dating or social networking products. Linguistik is a social matchmaking product
 to automatically match its users with compatible partners who can provide productive and engaging language practice.</p>

<p>For now the team is just Jenn and I. She'll lead design and product, and I'll lead development. Version 1 will be a
webapp written with Rails. I'll have a launch page and eventually a prototype up online at getlinguistik.com.</p>

<p>It would be wonderful to get into YC, but we know it's impossible to count on that. Either way, it was great to
experience the application process, and we're excited to build out the product. We'll give more updates as progress
continues!</p>
