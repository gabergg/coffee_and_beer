                <p><strong>The road trip begins!</strong> Gabe and I quit our jobs. We terminated our lease and I sold my car. Essentially, we were homeless, and I've never been so excited! We're going on a road trip across the United States and part of Canada! Before this road trip, my idea of “roughing it” was sleeping on the floor at a friends place. But since we no longer have jobs, we decided to camp at different state parks, stay at friend's places, and couchsurf to save money. Gabe had never camped before, and I had only done festival camping for 2 nights in which other people set up the tent for me. So, it'll be quite the experience sleeping outside in the cold!</p>

<p>Our first night of camping was at Pine Grove Furnace State Park. The mid-point of the Appalachian Trail actually runs through the park! We got there at around 9pm, so it was really dark setting up the tent. There were a few mistakes, but we'll do better next time =P. We ended up setting up the tent on a slight slope and we forgot to clear the small rocks and nuts from the ground before we set up the tent. I sleep on my side, so I kept rolling into Gabe in the middle of the night. It ended up being fine, but a bit of a rough night's sleep. Pretty good for the first night of camping in my opinion!</p>
