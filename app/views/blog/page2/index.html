                <p>When we tell people that we quit our jobs to go on a road trip for 6 months, the most common question is: “So...was there something that sparked this trip?” I think it's really interesting so many people have asked us this.</p>

<p>So, I'm going to try to answer this. I wouldn't say there was a specific moment that sparked this. Rather, Gabe and I have just been talking about this for a long time, and there really isn't ever a perfect time for something like this. We didn't have a family nor were we tied town to anything permanent. I knew if we didn't do it, it would always be a lingering “what if?”</p>

<p>I find that my life perspective changes every time I travel. Suddenly, the little things don't matter as much. You reconnect with hobbies you used to love and find out new things about yourself you didn't know before. I could spend X years at a company, hoping those 2 weeks of vacation come faster. ...Or I could go on a road trip. I'm not saying everyone should quit their jobs, but I do think that there is something to be said about the occasional trip. It's almost like a proverbial reset button. With that being said, it's been really nice thinking about what makes me happy and what I want to do going forward.</p>

                <p>On Tuesday night we submitted our application for YC!</p>

<p>For those of you that don't know, YCombinator is one of the most prestigious startup accelerators in the US. It's a
venture capital firm that provides support and community to its founders. We're applying with an idea for a language
learning product that we're calling Linguistik.</p>

<p>The most important piece of language learning is finding an opportunity to converse with native speakers. We think
there's a lot of room for improvement in the current tools to find a language partner. There's not a great way to find
a partner with similar interests, values, and skills. This is particularly frustrating because great matchmaking tools
 exist already - they're just applied to dating or social networking products. Linguistik is a social matchmaking product
 to automatically match its users with compatible partners who can provide productive and engaging language practice.</p>

<p>For now the team is just Jenn and I. She'll lead design and product, and I'll lead development. Version 1 will be a
webapp written with Rails. I'll have a launch page and eventually a prototype up online at getlinguistik.com.</p>

<p>It would be wonderful to get into YC, but we know it's impossible to count on that. Either way, it was great to
experience the application process, and we're excited to build out the product. We'll give more updates as progress
continues!</p>

                <p><strong>The road trip begins!</strong></p>

<p> Gabe and I quit our jobs. We terminated our lease and I sold my car. Essentially, we were homeless, and I've never been so excited! We're going on a road trip across the United States and part of Canada! Before this road trip, my idea of “roughing it” was sleeping on the floor at a friends place. But since we no longer have jobs, we decided to camp at different state parks, stay at friend's places, and couchsurf to save money. Gabe had never camped before, and I had only done festival camping for 2 nights in which other people set up the tent for me. So, it'll be quite the experience sleeping outside in the cold!</p>

<p>Our first night of camping was at Pine Grove Furnace State Park. The mid-point of the Appalachian Trail actually runs through the park! We got there at around 9pm, so it was really dark setting up the tent. There were a few mistakes, but we'll do better next time =P. We ended up setting up the tent on a slight slope and we forgot to clear the small rocks and nuts from the ground before we set up the tent. I sleep on my side, so I kept rolling into Gabe in the middle of the night. It ended up being fine, but a bit of a rough night's sleep. Pretty good for the first night of camping in my opinion!</p>

<p>Saline, Michigan > Pittsburgh, PA > Pine Grove Furnace State Park > Hershey, PA > Philadelphia, PA > New York City</p>
