   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Writing is tough. As time goes on, it seems like eloquence is harder and harder to come by.
I&#39;m hoping that a public-facing blog will motivate me not only to write regularly, but also to consciously improve my writing.
For now, the only goal I&#39;m setting for myself is to contribute to this blog at least once a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I plan to write about software, traveling, food, and whatever else comes to mind.
It&#39;s worth noting that Jenn will be writing as well, and there&#39;s no guarantee of coordination between our posts and/or topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to know at this point whether I made the right decision in leaving Yahoo. I can&#39;t imagine a better place
to start my career as a software developer, and I&#39;m so grateful for all that I learned in my 14 months in Sunnyvale.
I worked with some of the smartest people I&#39;ve ever met, and I learned more about software and computer science than
 I had through 4 years of coursework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on Yahoo Mail meant that my focus at work was entirely on the back-end of one product. This meant that the
primary focus of my life was the back-end of Yahoo Mail. Those 14 months were likely the most productive months of
my life. However, I also put my personal projects and passions on the back burner. I&#39;ve come to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing a product driven by passion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking a product from 0 to 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learning design and business aspects of a product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
