                <p>This was a couple weeks back, but I finally found time to blog about it.</p>

<p><strong> We did it! </strong> We hiked the Mount Pemigewasset via Indian Head Trail with an 1557 feet elevation gain. This is a panorama of the view from the top with my crappy camera.</p>

                <p>When we tell people that we quit our jobs to go on a road trip for 6 months, the most common question is: “So...was there something that sparked this trip?” I think it's really interesting so many people have asked us this.</p>

<p>So, I'm going to try to answer this. I wouldn't say there was a specific moment that sparked this. Rather, Gabe and I have just been talking about this for a long time, and there really isn't ever a perfect time for something like this. We didn't have a family nor were we tied town to anything permanent. I knew if we didn't do it, it would always be a lingering “what if?”</p>

<p>I find that my life perspective changes every time I travel. Suddenly, the little things don't matter as much. You reconnect with hobbies you used to love and find out new things about yourself you didn't know before. I could spend X years at a company, hoping those 2 weeks of vacation come faster. ...Or I could go on a road trip. I'm not saying everyone should quit their jobs, but I do think that there is something to be said about the occasional trip. It's almost like a proverbial reset button. With that being said, it's been really nice thinking about what makes me happy and what I want to do going forward.</p>

                <p>On Tuesday night we submitted our application for YC!</p>

<p>For those of you that don't know, YCombinator is one of the most prestigious startup accelerators in the US. It's a
venture capital firm that provides support and community to its founders. We're applying with an idea for a language
learning product that we're calling Linguistik.</p>

<p>The most important piece of language learning is finding an opportunity to converse with native speakers. We think
there's a lot of room for improvement in the current tools to find a language partner. There's not a great way to find
a partner with similar interests, values, and skills. This is particularly frustrating because great matchmaking tools
 exist already - they're just applied to dating or social networking products. Linguistik is a social matchmaking product
 to automatically match its users with compatible partners who can provide productive and engaging language practice.</p>

<p>For now the team is just Jenn and I. She'll lead design and product, and I'll lead development. Version 1 will be a
webapp written with Rails. I'll have a launch page and eventually a prototype up online at getlinguistik.com.</p>

<p>It would be wonderful to get into YC, but we know it's impossible to count on that. Either way, it was great to
experience the application process, and we're excited to build out the product. We'll give more updates as progress
continues!</p>
