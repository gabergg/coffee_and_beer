                <p>We just came off a wonderful two-day stint in Minneapolis, MN. We were pretty exhausted heading into Minnesota, and the weather had
taken a turn for the worst. Thankfully, we were able to rest up at the beautiful house of Anne and David F., right on Lake Riley.</p>

<p>One morning we woke up to a pileated woodpecker in the backyard and a bald eagle fishing on the lake. We learned about ice
boating, maple syrup, and Swarm. We're incredibly thankful to Anne and David for their generosity and hospitality.</p>

<hr />

<p>Who knew Minnesota had a coffee scene? We weren't able to try all of the coffee roasters in town, but we checked out Dogwood,
Bull Run, and Five Watt. We were most impressed with Five Watt, followed by Dogwood. Bull Run has a nice vibe - it seems
like a place to study while sipping a sweetened latte - but the coffee didn't live up to the others.</p>

<p>Minneapolis had some good Chinese and Vietnamese food too! We really enjoyed the city, and if their tech scene is as good as
their food scene, we might have to check out their job listings...</p>

                <p>This was a couple weeks back, but I finally found time to blog about it.</p>

<p><strong> We did it! </strong> We hiked the Mount Pemigewasset via Indian Head Trail with an 1557 feet elevation gain. This is a panorama of the view from the top with my crappy camera.</p>

                <p>When we tell people that we quit our jobs to go on a road trip for 6 months, the most common question is: “So...was there something that sparked this trip?” I think it's really interesting so many people have asked us this.</p>

<p>So, I'm going to try to answer this. I wouldn't say there was a specific moment that sparked this. Rather, Gabe and I have just been talking about this for a long time, and there really isn't ever a perfect time for something like this. We didn't have a family nor were we tied town to anything permanent. I knew if we didn't do it, it would always be a lingering “what if?”</p>

<p>I find that my life perspective changes every time I travel. Suddenly, the little things don't matter as much. You reconnect with hobbies you used to love and find out new things about yourself you didn't know before. I could spend X years at a company, hoping those 2 weeks of vacation come faster. ...Or I could go on a road trip. I'm not saying everyone should quit their jobs, but I do think that there is something to be said about the occasional trip. It's almost like a proverbial reset button. With that being said, it's been really nice thinking about what makes me happy and what I want to do going forward.</p>
