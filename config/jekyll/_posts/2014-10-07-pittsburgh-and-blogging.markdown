Writing is tough. As time goes on, it seems like eloquence is harder and harder to come by.
I'm hoping that a public-facing blog will motivate me not only to write regularly, but also to consciously improve my writing.
For now, the only goal I'm setting for myself is to contribute to this blog at least once a week.

I plan to write about software, traveling, food, and whatever else comes to mind.
It's worth noting that Jenn will be writing as well, and there's no guarantee of coordination between our posts and/or topics.

Here goes!
