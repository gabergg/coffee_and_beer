Writing is tough. As time goes on, it seems like eloquence is harder and harder to come by.
I'm hoping that a public-facing blog will motivate me not only to write regularly, but also to consciously improve my writing.
For now, the only goal I'm setting for myself is to contribute to this blog at least once a week.

I plan to write about software, traveling, food, and whatever else comes to mind.
It's worth noting that Jenn will be writing as well, and there's no guarantee of coordination between our posts and/or topics.

Here goes!

It's hard to know at this point whether I made the right decision in leaving Yahoo. I can't imagine a better place
to start my career as a software developer, and I'm so grateful for all that I learned in my 14 months in Sunnyvale.
I worked with some of the smartest people I've ever met, and I learned more about software and computer science than
I had through 4 years of coursework.

Working on Yahoo Mail meant that my focus at work was entirely on the back-end of one product. This meant that the
primary focus of my life was the back-end of Yahoo Mail. Those 14 months were likely the most productive months of
my life. However, I also put my personal projects and passions on the back burner. I left Yahoo to travel and work
full-speed on a couple of projects. I hope to gain experience that was hard for me to gain at a large
tech company:  

 * Developing a product driven by passion
 * Creating a product from scratch
 * Learning non-software aspects of a product, e.g. design and finance  
     
Jenn and I will be applying to Y Combinator next week. We know how competitive YC is. The experience of applying will
be valuable in itself and will act to motivate us in the development of a prototype. I look forward to building a
product from nothing with a partner as wonderful and capable as Jenn.
