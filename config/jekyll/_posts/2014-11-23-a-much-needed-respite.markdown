We just came off a wonderful two-day stint in Minneapolis, MN. We were pretty exhausted heading into Minnesota, and the weather had 
taken a turn for the worst. Thankfully, we were able to rest up at the beautiful house of Anne and David F., right on Lake Riley.

One morning we woke up to a pileated woodpecker in the backyard and a bald eagle fishing on the lake. We learned about ice 
boating, maple syrup, and Swarm. We're incredibly thankful to Anne and David for their generosity and hospitality.

Who knew Minnesota had a coffee scene? We weren't able to try all of the coffee roasters in town, but we checked out Dogwood, 
Bull Run, and Five Watt. We were most impressed with Five Watt, followed by Dogwood. Bull Run has a nice vibe - it seems 
like a place to study while sipping a sweetened latte - but the coffee didn't live up to the others.

Minneapolis had some good Chinese and Vietnamese food too! We really enjoyed the city, and if their tech scene is as good as 
their food scene, we might have to check out their job listings...
