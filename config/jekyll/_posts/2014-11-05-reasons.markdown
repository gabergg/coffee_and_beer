title: An Answer to a Common Question

When we tell people that we quit our jobs to go on a road trip for 6 months, the most common question is: “So...was there something that sparked this trip?” I think it's really interesting so many people have asked us this. 

So, I'm going to try to answer this. I wouldn't say there was a specific moment that sparked this. Rather, Gabe and I didn't really see ourselves at our jobs long term, and there really isn't ever a perfect time for something like this. We didn't have a family nor were we tied town to anything permanent. I knew if we didn't do it, it would always be a lingering “what if?”   

I find that my life perspective changes every time I travel. Suddenly, the little things don't matter as much. You reconnect with hobbies you used to love and find out new things about yourself you didn't know before. I could spend X years at a company, hoping those 2 weeks of vacation come faster. ...Or I could go on a road trip. I'm not saying everyone should quit their jobs, but I do think that there is something to be said about the occasional trip. It's almost like a proverbial reset button. With that being said, it's been really nice thinking about what makes me happy and what I want to do going forward.
